## Summary
The Xcel Energy Cabin Creek Fire occurred on October 2, 2007, at Xcel Energyâ€™s pumped storage hydroelectric plant near Georgetown, Colorado, a small town forty-five miles west of Denver. The accident killed five workers and injured three. The incident is thought to be the result of shoddy work by a contractor (RPI Coating) and Xcel Energy's willingness to cut costs at the expense of safety.

## Key Learnings:
1. contractor selection and oversight
2. lack of pre-work safety planning
3. use of a flammable solvent within a confined space
4. lack of emergency response planning

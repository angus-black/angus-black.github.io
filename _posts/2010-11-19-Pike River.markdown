## Summary
The Pike River Mine disaster was a coal mining accident that began on 19 November 2010 in the Pike River Mine, 46 km (29 mi) northeast of Greymouth, in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island following a methane explosion at approximately 3:44 pm. The accident resulted in the deaths of 29 miners whose remains have never been recovered.


## Key Learnings / Issues
1. A focus on production (at the expense of safety).
2. Lack of emergency response planning.
3. Leadership, operational systems and cultural problems.
4. Inadequate oversight of the mine by a health and safety regulator.
5. Better communications during the search, rescue and recovery phases.

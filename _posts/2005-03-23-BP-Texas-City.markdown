## Summary
At approximately 1:20 p.m. on March 23, 2005, a series of explosions occurred at the BP Texas City refinery during the restarting of a hydrocarbon isomerization unit. Fifteen workers were killed and 180 others were injured. Many of the victims were in or around work trailers located near an atmospheric vent stack. The explosions occurred when a distillation tower flooded with hydrocarbons and was overpressurized, causing a geyser-like release from the vent stack.

## Key Learnings:
1. deviations from procedures (during equipment start-up)
2. malfunctioning / incorrect equipment (level switches / indicators)
3. communication breakdown (during handover)
4. lack of experienced personnel (when shift supervisor left site)

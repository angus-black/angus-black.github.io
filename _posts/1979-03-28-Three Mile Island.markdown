## Summary
The Three Mile Island accident was a partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island, Unit 2 (TMI-2) reactor in Pennsylvania, United States. It began at 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979. It is the most significant accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history. Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1 billion (equivalent to $2 billion in 2021).


## Key Learnings / Issues
1. Inadequate instrumentation and training programs at the time hampered operators' ability to respond to the accident.
2. The containment building worked as designed. Despite melting of about one-third of the fuel core, the reactor vessel itself maintained its integrity and contained the damaged fuel.
3. Lack of prioritisation on alarm signals in the control room; several alarms triggered at the same time, which contributed to disorientating the operators.
4. The disaster served as a wakeup call for the industry, which quickly realized that an accident at any facility would adversely impact all reactor operators.
5. The accident was accompanied by communications problems that led to conflicting information available to the public, contributing to the public's fears.

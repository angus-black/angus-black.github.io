As an Engineer working in Asset Integrity for over 10 years, safety is critical to my everyday. In 2019, I realised there was no single source of data I could review, for learnings on catastrophic safety incidents either within Australia or globally. After making this discovery, I started collecting videos, reports and learnings from significant incidents I could learn from – leading to the creation of Safety Critical.

Reviewing historical data, there is almost always an incident that has occurred in some way before. Whether it be an aircraft crash or a drilling rig fire, humans continue to make errors, and technology continues to fail. It is important we learn the lessons from these incidents to prevent loss - as much as feasibly possible - in the future. This can include loss of infrastructure and assets, financial loss, and most importantly loss of life.

As Engineers, Inspectors, Operators or Regulators, there is meaning behind the work we do. Those frustrating Excel spreadsheets, collecting thickness reading data, and the pile of paperwork required to start a project all have meaning and a purpose of preventing loss. Each incident captured on this site has ‘Key Learnings’ highlighted, to arm you with knowledge and potentially prevent a future incident occurring.

I will continue to add content to Safety Critical as it arises. If you have a particular interest in an incident that is not included or have information you see as having safety critical relevance, please contact me directly on LinkedIn.

Be Safe, Don.
